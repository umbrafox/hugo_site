## In Every Step A Journey

My heartâ€™s been into coding for a while. Iâ€™m talking the days of Geocities and Angelfire, where you could patch together fansites for your Neopets and favorite Nickolodeon shows if you were nerdy and bored enough. But like any True Millenial, I started really learning web development through Myspace. At the time I didnâ€™t think my obsession with learning how to paste and autoplay a Fall Out Boy completely respectable music video on my profile would lead to any sort of career, but the drive to make my ideas a reality has always been this nagging itch.

Thereâ€™s something uniquely cool about industries that mesh technical skill with creativityâ€“web development hooked me from the start. I havenâ€™t had many opportunities to really pursue a career in the tech industry and Iâ€™ve been pretty stoked about TechHire since I first read about the program through a meetup email blast. Iâ€™d love to see Open Code through to the end and Iâ€™m excited to expand upon the few hobbyist skills I already have in web development. Maybe the goofy ten-year-old in me will create the next generationâ€™s Neopets. We can only hope
